#           Dollar Cost Averaging (Martingale) settings
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# DCA is a method for averaging down the price of a losing trade,
# hoping the price will come up to your lower average buy price.
#
# For a more in-depth explanation see here:
#      http://forexop.com/martingale-trading-system-overview
#

# Define the TOTAL amount a single pair is allowed to cost you when using DCA.
#
# Note: use this setting carefully!
# If set to 0 this option is ignored and there is no max cost.
# The bot will keep using DCA until you run out of balance
#
# Example: you set max_cost = 0.01 and you bought 0.005 BTC.
# Because max_cost is 0.01 you are allowed to double up 1 time.
#
# -------------------------------------  WARNING -------------------------------------
#
# Using the Martingale strategy your trade exposure on a losing sequence increases exponentially.
# Remember that each time ANDEERSON DCA makes a buy it will double your current quantity of that pair.
# That means it has the potential to use your entire trading budget, therefore, you MUST consider using a low
# DEFAULT_DCA_max_cost.
#
# We also need to avoid the Taleb dilema https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taleb_distribution
# which states the greater your drawdown limit, the lower your probability of making a loss ? but the bigger that loss will be.
# So we therefore have put other protection mechanisms throughout the settings to ensure we pick good pairs and minimise loss.
# None of these can guarantee that you will be safe so heed this warning and adjust the below value to suit your trading style.
